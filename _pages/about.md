I am a forth-year student from Shandong university, my research interest lies in 3D reconstruction, and I hope to help build a beautiful AR/VR world and empower many fields.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Sida Peng](https://pengsida.net/) at the key of CAD&CG, Zhejiang Univeristy. During my junior year at Shandong Univeristy, I collaborated with [Prof.Zhe Min](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/minzhe/zh_CN/index.htm). You can find my [CV]() hear.

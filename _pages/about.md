I am a forth-year student from [Chongxin Honors School](https://github.com/CXXT-Projects/CXXT-Projects.github.io), Shandong university, which is an elite program at SDU. My research interest lies in 3D reconstruction, and I hope to help build a beautiful AR/VR world and empower many fields.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Sida Peng](https://pengsida.net/) and [Prof.Xiaowei Zhou](https://xzhou.me/) at the key of CAD&CG, Zhejiang Univeristy. During my junior year at Shandong Univeristy, I collaborated with [Prof.Zhe Min](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/minzhe/zh_CN/index.htm). You can find my [CV](https://github.com/RitianYu/RitianYu.github.io/blob/master/files/个人简历.pdf) hear.
